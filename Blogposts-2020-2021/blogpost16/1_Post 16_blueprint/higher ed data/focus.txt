for this weeks analysis, i will focus on the following.

now, with the codes locked down.

we can cut the data by state.

then aggregate for each year. or select lowest and highest values to display spreads.

or just select mean and median for each state.

the measures we can focus on are:


-- offerings

-- admissions test scores, enrollment

-- completions

-- financial aid

-- staff employed, pay

we will limit our attention to the years 2004 onward, totalling 15 years worth of data.
