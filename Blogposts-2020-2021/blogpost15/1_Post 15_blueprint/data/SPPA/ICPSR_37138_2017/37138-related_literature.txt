This report analyzes data from the 2017 Survey of Public Participation in
the Arts (SPPA), which the National Endowment for the Arts
conducted in partnership with the U.S. Census Bureau. It gives a
statistical overview of how the nation’s adults engage with leisure
reading and other literary activities, such as author readings, book clubs,
and creative writing. The survey identifies three groups of
adults: nonreaders, print-only readers, and digital/audio readers. (The
latter category describes adults who read e-books or listened to
audiobooks, but who also may have read books in print.)
Previous reports from the National Endowment for the Arts have shown long-
term declines in book-reading and in the reading of
literary texts—e.g., novels and short stories. For those who care about the
future of books and literature, the new report attests to the
vitality of digital and audio platforms in today’s literary culture. For
example, when we account for adults who listen to audiobooks, the
total number of adults who engage with books is more comparable to figures
from previous years. Also, the data show that while older
readers read books at higher rates than do younger adults, digital/audio
reading is more common among younger than older readers.
Indeed, digital/audio readers consume more books on average and engage in
other cultural activities at higher rates than do print-only
readers
