# SAS_sample_code
Code written as part of a mock litigation process between Texas oil companies

The SAS code here analyzes insights by category, and creates new categories to produce insights regarding the oil delivery- 
distance, time, rates.

The xlsx files include information on miles per oil haul, rate, and times of the day. Each xlsx file represents a different month. 

The original analysis was conducted for a project in Fall 2016. This updated version is from Fall 2018.
