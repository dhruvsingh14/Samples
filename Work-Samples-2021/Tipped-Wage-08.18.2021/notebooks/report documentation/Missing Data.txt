Rules for imputing missing values

i. If total wages is missing, and calculated_salary is calculable (i.e. hourly wage rate and hours are present) , 
replace total wages with calculated_salary

ii. If calculated_salary = 0, and total wages is present, along with another column such as wage rate, or hours, calculate the missing column:

eg. hours = total wages/hourly wage rate. (if hours missing)

or wage rate = total wages/hours (if wage rate missing)
